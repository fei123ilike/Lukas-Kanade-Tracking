# Lucas-Kanade-tracking-and-Correlation-Filters
This repository contains implementation of **Lucas-Kanade algorithm** proposed by Lucas and Kanade. Lucas-Kanade algorithm can be used for **sparse optical flow** (associate feature points across frames) and **tracking** (associate image patch cross frames). 

This repo implements the algorithm for tracking a single template across 400 frames video.
